	<h3>INTRODUCTION TO WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND BASIC COMPUTER OPERATIONS</h3>
	<p>The Microsoft Windows Operating System (Windows) is an advancement of Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). It provides a more user-friendly environment by representing MSDOS commands with graphics/icons in the mode known as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Other advantages of Windows include; support for pointing devices, Multi-tasking, Multi-users and Networking support. Though, there are several versions of Microsoft Windows Operating System (Windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, Window7, Window8, Window10), however, the version used in this discussion is Windows 10. You may therefore have a different layout if you have other versions of Microsoft Windows installed on your system.</p>
	<h3>LEARNING OUTCOME</h3>
	<p>At the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Start a computer system (Starting, Log-in and Restarting)</li>
 		<li>Identify and explain various components of a computer desktop:- Icons for folder, file and shortcut - Task bar - Start Button</li>
 		<li>Perform and explain basic mouse operations: Pointing (viewing), Clicking (selecting), Double Clicking (selecting and opening), Dragging (moving) and Right Clicking (exploring)</li>
 		<li>Create and explore Folder, File and Shortcut.</li>
 		<li>Perform basic file management operations: (saving, moving, renaming, printing, deleting and restoring deleted file from Recycle-bin)</li>
 		<li>Turn off the Computer System with various options (Stand by, Hibernate, Shut-down and Restart)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Easy to learn</li>
	<li>Structured language</li>
 	<li>It produces efficient programs</li>
 	<li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
 	<li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>
 </ul>
 	<h3>facts about c language</h3>
 	<ol>
 		<li>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li>
 		<li>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</li>
 		<li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
            The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</li>
 		<li>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</li>
 		<li>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</li>
 		<li>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</li>
 	</ol>
 	<h3>Why we use c?</h3>
 	<p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>Language Compilers</li>
		 <li>Assemblers</li>
		 <li>Text Editors</li>
		 <li>Print Spoolers</li>
		 <li>Network Drivers</li>
		 <li>Modern Programs</li>
		 <li>Databases</li>
		 <li>Language Interpreters</li>
		 <li>Utilities</li>
 	</ul>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE</h3>
<p>Assembly language is one level machine language.it uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that data.one might thus write "add pay,total" instead "0110101100101000" for an instruction that adds two numbers.</p>
<p>
	Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language.Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses,assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information.like machine language,assemly language requires detailed knowleddge of internal <u>computer architecture.</u>it is useful when such details are importance ,as in programming a computer to interact with <u>input/output devices</u>(printers,scanner,storage device,and so forth).

<h3>Introducing HTML:</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hypertext  refers  to  the  way  in  which  Web  pages  (HTML  documents)  are  linked together. When you click a link in a Web page, you are using hypertext.</li>
	<li>Markup Language describes how HTML works. With a markup language, you simply "mark up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs,  lists,  and so  forth  to  facilitate the sharing of  scientific  information between researchers.

All you need to do to use HTML is to learn what type of markup to use to get the results you want.
