		<p>The Professional Development Program (PDP) is SFU's highly-regarded teacher education program.
  Established in 1965, the PDP has helped to develop more than 20,000 teachers in British Columbia making it one of the province's oldest and most successful teacher education programs.

  Student teachers who successfully complete the 16-month program are recommended to the Teacher Certification Branch of the BC Ministry of Education for a Teaching Certificate. There is also an option to complete a Bachelor of Education (BEd) as a second degree during the program.
  The PDP has four, full-time semesters that integrate theory and practice to help student teachers explore important education ideas and their application in the classroom. Student teachers work in small cohorts throughout the program and have extended opportunities to interact and build relationships with their peers, teacher educators, and practicing K-12 teachers. Unlike other programs, the PDP also has a unique staffing model that employs highly skilled, seconded teachers as Faculty Associates. These Faculty Associates work closely alongside Faculty Members as the program's teacher educators.
All degree Programmesare are duration of four years of eleven semesters for students addmitted through Direct entry into 200 Level.

	<h2 id="Direct Entry info">Direct Entry</h2>
		<p>Direct entry is a style of entry into any Nigerian university straight to 200/300level. Typically, when you obtain the unified tertiary matriculation examination form and sit for the examination, you can only gain admission into 100level in any Nigerian university, but if you decide to get the direct entry form and you eventually meet the basic admission requirement, you will gain admission into that university of your choice and you will begin from 200/300level. This strICTly depends on the entry credentials you used to gain admission.
